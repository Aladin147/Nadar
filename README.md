# Nadar ‚Äî AI‚ÄëPowered Visual Assistance

Nadar is a voice‚Äëfirst assistive application that helps blind and low‚Äëvision users understand their surroundings using the device camera and on‚Äëdevice/gallery images. The project consists of a cross‚Äëplatform React Native (Expo) client and a TypeScript/Express server that wraps foundation models for vision understanding (Gemini) and text‚Äëto‚Äëspeech (Gemini TTS with optional ElevenLabs fallback).

This README provides a technical overview for developers: architecture, setup, build, testing, endpoints, and operational guidance.

- Accessibility ‚Äî consolidated onboarding, large touch targets, focused flows

## üìö Enhanced Documentation

- **[Accessibility Testing Guide](docs/accessibility-testing.md)** ‚Äî Comprehensive VoiceOver/TalkBack testing procedures, performance targets, and systematic validation
- **[API Reference](docs/api-reference.md)** ‚Äî Complete endpoint documentation with examples, error codes, rate limits, and SDK integration patterns
- **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md)** ‚Äî Production deployment instructions for Docker, cloud platforms, VPS setup, and monitoring

## üê≥ Docker Support

Nadar now includes production-ready Docker configurations:

- **Multi-stage builds** with security hardening and health checks
- **Development environment** with hot reload and debugging support
- **Docker Compose** orchestration with networking, monitoring, and scaling options
- **Automated setup script** (`docker-setup.sh`) for easy environment management

Quick start with Docker:

```bash
# Development environment
./docker-setup.sh dev

# Production environment
./docker-setup.sh prod

# With monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
./docker-setup.sh monitoring
```

## Architecture overview

Client (Expo/React Native)

- CameraView (Expo) for capture on mobile; image picker on web
- Segmented modes: scene | ocr | qa
- Results screen with structured sections and TTS playback
- Settings screen stores API base, language, verbosity, TTS provider
- State: lightweight context in app/src/app/state
- UI Kit aligned to the design guide (theme.ts, Card/Button/Chip/etc.)

Server (Express + TypeScript)

- Providers implement IAIProvider interface
  - GeminiProvider ‚Äî vision and TTS (primary)
  - ElevenLabsProvider ‚Äî optional TTS fallback
  - HybridProvider ‚Äî orchestrates provider selection/fallback
- Routes: /describe, /ocr, /qa, /tts (zod input validation)
- Ops: morgan logging, express-rate-limit, CORS, JSON body parser
- Enhanced telemetry with consistent error codes, route paths, and debugging info
- Comprehensive error handling with ProviderError preservation

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Server**: 27 comprehensive tests covering providers, error handling, and telemetry
- **App**: Jest + Expo testing setup with utility function validation
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for both server and app packages
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier integration with consistent formatting rules
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive type checking

## Server: configuration

Environment variables (server/.env or process env):

- GEMINI_API_KEY ‚Äî required for Gemini models
- GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS ‚Äî optional, default 30000
- GEMINI_TTS_TIMEOUT_MS ‚Äî optional, default 20000
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY ‚Äî optional (enables ElevenLabs TTS fallback)
- PORT ‚Äî optional, default 4000

Server binds to 0.0.0.0:PORT for LAN/tunnel access.

---

## App: configuration

- EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE ‚Äî optional override for default API base on web
- On mobile, API base is set in Settings (persisted). A Mobile Setup screen guides discovery or manual entry.

---

## Install & run

Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- Expo Go (for device testing)

Install

- Server
  - cd server && npm install
- App
  - cd app && npm install

Development

- Server (dev, ts-node):
  - cd server && npm run dev
- App (web):
  - cd app && npm run web
- App (Expo Go with tunnel):
  - cd app && npm run mobile

Build

- Server (TypeScript ‚Üí dist):
  - cd server && npm run build
- Start built server:
  - node dist/index.js

Mobile connectivity

- See README-MOBILE.md and docs/mobile-setup.md for LAN vs tunnel setup, auto‚Äëdiscovery, and troubleshooting.

---

## HTTP API (server)

Base URL: `http://HOST:4000` (example)

- GET /health ‚Üí { ok: true }

**Note**: Current production API uses `/api/*-shared` endpoints. See `docs/api.md` for complete reference.

Legacy server endpoints (if running locally):

- POST /describe
- POST /ocr
- POST /qa
- POST /tts

Notes:

- Requests enforce timeouts to keep latency predictable
- Current production uses shared-core architecture with Vercel serverless endpoints
- HybridProvider decides how to serve TTS (Gemini primary; ElevenLabs if configured)

---

## Client internals (selected)

- CaptureScreen ‚Äî camera/web upload, mode selection, dispatches API calls
- ResultsScreen ‚Äî shows structured output, actions (copy/share/tts)
- SettingsScreen ‚Äî API base, language, verbosity, TTS provider; connection test
- MobileSetupScreen ‚Äî auto‚Äëdiscovery and manual configuration helpers
- API client ‚Äî app/src/api/client.ts (resolveApiBase, retry, health test)

---

## Testing

Server

- Unit tests (jest, ts-jest configured)
- Run: cd server && npm test

App

- Jest + jest-expo scaffolded (expand with component tests as features grow)
- Run: cd app && npm test

---

## Troubleshooting

CI: lockfile mismatch

- Regenerate app/server package-lock.json with `npm install` in each package

Mobile cannot reach server

- Ensure both devices on same LAN and server bound to 0.0.0.0
- Use `npm run mobile` (tunnel) as a fallback for quick tests
- Use Settings ‚Üí Test Connection or MobileSetup auto‚Äëdiscovery

Camera/Photo permissions

- Re‚Äërun onboarding from Landing screen, accept camera & library permissions

---

## Security & secrets

- Do not commit API keys or prompt files
- .gitignore excludes common key/cert patterns, Sys_Prompts, and prototype HTMLs
- If a sensitive file was added, run `git rm --cached <file>` then commit

---

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict across server/client
- Accessible, focused UX; avoid adding friction to core flow
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/chore)

---

## License

TBD.
