# Nadar Mobile Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start for Mobile Testing

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Expo Go** on your mobile device:
   - [Android: Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - [iOS: App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. **Ensure both devices are connected** to the same WiFi network

### Method 1: Tunnel Mode (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the app with tunnel
cd app  
npm run mobile
```

1. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go app on your mobile device
2. **App will load** - no additional configuration needed!
3. **Test the flow**: Landing ‚Üí Start Using Nadar ‚Üí Capture Screen

### Method 2: Local Network (Faster Performance)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the app normally
cd app
npm start
```

1. **Find your computer's IP address**:
   - Windows: Open Command Prompt, run `ipconfig`
   - Mac: Open Terminal, run `ifconfig`
   - Look for IPv4/inet address (usually starts with 192.168 or 10.0)

2. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go app

3. **Configure server in app**:
   - App will show "Mobile Setup Required" screen
   - Tap "Auto-Discover Server" (tries to find server automatically)
   - OR tap "Manual Setup" and enter `http://YOUR_IP:4000`

## üîß Mobile-Specific Features

### Consolidated Onboarding
- **Single landing screen** explains all three modes
- **One-click setup** requests all permissions at once
- **Direct transition** to capture screen (no multi-step onboarding)

### Smart Server Discovery
- **Auto-discovery** scans common IP ranges to find the server
- **Manual configuration** with helpful IP suggestions
- **Connection testing** before allowing app usage

### Mobile-Optimized Settings
- **Server IP configuration** with common address suggestions
- **Auto-discovery button** for easy setup
- **Clear instructions** for finding computer's IP address
