# Nadar App Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values (optional)

# === OPTIONAL ===

# API Base URL Override
# Only needed for web development if you want to override the default localhost:4000
# On mobile, the API base is configured in the Settings screen and persisted locally
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://your-server-host:4000

# === DEVELOPMENT NOTES ===

# The app will:
# - Use localhost:4000 as default API base on web
# - Require manual configuration or auto-discovery on mobile
# - Store API base, language, verbosity, and TTS settings in AsyncStorage
# - Auto-discover servers on the local network when needed

# For mobile development:
# - No environment variables are typically needed
# - Use the Mobile Setup screen for initial configuration
# - The app will scan your network for available servers
# - Settings are persisted across app restarts
